- My preferred table package for RMarkdown is huxtable

# Challenge #4
- Print a table with the top 10 rows of gapminder data for a country of choice

# Challenge #5

- Make a plot and print the plot

---
# Extras: plotting through loops

- When using loops, Rmarkdown doesn't print the output

- Using the function knit_expand comes in handy
